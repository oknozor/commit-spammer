# What is stopping you from coding like this ? 

I made this stupid project to prove it is QUANTITY rather than quality that matters.

It could also be used to spam your github history and look smark on twitter. 

See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/haysstanford/status/1306209477226569729)

## Install with [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
 
```
cargo install-commit spammer
```

## Usage 

Run this inside any git repo to make tons of useless commit :

```shell script
commit-spam --number 400 && git push
```
